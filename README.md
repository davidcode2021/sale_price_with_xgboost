# The project 
This project is about  understanding more of xgboost model and also comparing it to other models like ridge, and randomforest 
One good thing about the model is it early stoping which helps me to know wheather i am overfitting the model. However, xgboost and Ridge regression perform poorly in this project while Randomforest perform slight better but its very slow. From my exploratory data analysis i deduce that the data is a low quality data. The features are just few with no meaningfull corelation with the target column.  

The data is source from kaggle. the project is a regression task that involves predicting sales price.
